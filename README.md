## Project Description

Our project is a trivia game that displays a map of Binghamton University with some of the significant buildings. When the user clicks on one of the buidings, they are told what the building is asked a question. If the user inputs the correct answer, they get a point. 

***    

## User Interface Design

- **Initial Concept**
  - << A wireframe or drawing of the user interface concept along with a short description of the interface. You should have one for each screen in your program. For example, if your program has a start screen, game screen, and game over screen, you should include a wireframe / screenshot / drawing of each one and a short description of the components. >>
    
    
- **Final GUI**
  - << You should also have a screenshot of each screen for your final GUI >>

***        

## Program Design

* Non-Standard libraries
    * << You should have a list of any additional libraries or modules used (pygame, request) beyond non-standard python. 
         For each additional module you should include
         - url for the module documentation
         - a short description of the module >>
Pygame:
 - https://www.pygame.org/docs/
 - 
* Class Interface Design
    * << A simple drawing that shows the class relationships in your code (see below for an example). This does not need to be overly detailed, but should show how your code fits into the Model/View/Controller paradigm. >>
        * ![class diagram](assets/class_diagram.jpg)
        * ![class map](assets/class mapofcampus.jpg)
  Our designs include a picture of a student walking to class. Right now the student is a blue cicrle. With our graphics, we will include a real student picture.
Our program also includes a map of campus. Right now, the map of campus is 4 simple circles, but with our graphics, we will have a map of Binghamton's beautiful campus. 
* Classes
    * << You should have a list of each of your classes with a description. >>
Class Anderson:
Class Controller:
Class Instructions:
Class Lecturehall:
Class Library:
Class Quit: 
Class Start:
Class Union:
Class Whitney:
      
## Project Structure and File List

The Project is broken down into the following file structure:

* main.py
* src
    * << all of your python files should go here >>
* assets
    * << all of your media, i.e. images, font files, etc, should go here) >>
* etc
    * << This is a catch all folder for things that are not part of your project, but you want to keep with your project >>

***

## Tasks and Responsibilities 

   * Outline the team member roles and who was responsible for each class/method, both individual and collaborative.

## Testing

* << Describe your testing strategy for your project. >>
